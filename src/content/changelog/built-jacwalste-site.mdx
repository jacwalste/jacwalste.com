This site you're reading right now came together in a single session. I wanted a space that felt different from my main portfolio â€” something more raw, more terminal-like, more *me*.

## The Stack

- **Next.js 16** with App Router
- **TailwindCSS v4** for styling
- **MDX** for these changelog entries
- **TypeScript** because I'm not a monster

## The Vibe

Retro forest cabin terminal. Deep greens, amber text, monospace fonts. Think 70's analog warmth meets modern dev tools.

I'm using:
- `DM Serif Display` for headers
- `JetBrains Mono` for that terminal feel
- A subtle CRT flicker effect (just enough to be nostalgic)

## What's Next

- More changelog entries as I build
- Actual projects to showcase
- Maybe some ASCII art if I'm feeling fancy
- Integration with GitHub activity feed?

The goal is to keep this updated like a real build log. Short, honest entries about what I'm making and breaking.
